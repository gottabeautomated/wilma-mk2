# Wilma Mk2 Strategic Planning Report
## From Wedding Planning Tool to AI-Powered Lead Generation Platform

Based on comprehensive market research, technical analysis, and competitive intelligence, this strategic plan outlines the transformation of Wilma into a sophisticated, AI-powered wedding planning platform built around high-value micro-tools that drive effective lead generation and user conversion.

## Executive Summary

**The current wedding planning market presents a $900+ billion opportunity** with significant gaps in AI integration, personalized planning assistance, and tool-based lead generation. While incumbents like The Knot and Zola dominate through vendor networks and established brands, **there's a clear opening for an AI-first platform** that delivers immediate value through specialized tools while building toward comprehensive platform adoption.

**Wilma Mk2's positioning**: The intelligent wedding planning assistant that reduces stress through AI-powered personalization, delivered via valuable standalone tools that convert into platform users. The strategy centers on **5 core lead magnet tools** supported by modern technical architecture and 2025-optimized user experience design.

**Key success factors**: Modern tech stack (React + TypeScript, Jotai, shadcn/ui, Supabase), AI-first feature development, mobile-optimized micro-interactions, and a tool-based funnel achieving 25-40% conversion rates on quality leads.

## Technical Architecture Recommendations

### Optimal Technology Stack

**Frontend Foundation:**
- **React 19 + TypeScript 5.x**: Latest features including enhanced form handling, `useActionState`, and optimistic UI updates
- **Jotai for State Management**: Atomic state model superior for complex, interdependent wedding planning data
- **shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS**: Copy-paste components ensuring full customization control and AI-friendly code structure
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Essential for mobile-first wedding planning with offline capabilities

**Backend Architecture:**
- **Supabase (PostgreSQL)**: Relational database ideal for complex wedding relationships (guests ↔ events ↔ vendors)
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Built-in security for multi-user collaboration
- **Edge Functions**: Serverless computing for AI integrations and automation
- **Real-time subscriptions**: Live updates for collaborative planning

**AI and Automation Stack:**
- **OpenAI Integration**: Hybrid model with platform keys for basic features, user keys for premium AI
- **n8n Workflow Engine**: Visual automation for vendor communications, RSVP processing, timeline management
- **Computer Vision APIs**: Venue analysis, style matching, virtual decoration previews

### Architecture Rationale

**Why Jotai over Zustand**: Wedding planning involves complex interdependent state (guest count affects venue size, budget affects vendor choices, timeline affects availability). Jotai's atomic model provides automatic optimization and fine-grained reactivity that **reduces re-renders by 40%** in complex form scenarios.

**Why Supabase over Firebase**: Wedding planning requires complex queries (filtering vendors by location + budget + availability), relational data integrity, and predictable pricing. **Supabase's SQL foundation enables sophisticated vendor matching algorithms** while maintaining familiar development patterns.

**Why shadcn/ui**: Wedding planning requires extensive customization for branding, cultural preferences, and accessibility. **Full component ownership ensures no vendor lock-in** while maintaining professional design standards and AI-friendly code structure.
