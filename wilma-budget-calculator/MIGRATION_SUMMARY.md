# Budget Calculator Migration Summary

## Overview
This document outlines the migration of the Budget Calculator from the original Wilma project into the new monorepo structure, with shared packages for reusable components, types, and utilities.

## Shared Packages Structure

### @wilma/shared-types
- Budget calculator types moved to shared package for reuse across apps
- Includes `BudgetFormData`, `BudgetBreakdown`, and `BudgetResult` interfaces

### @wilma/shared-utils
- Common utilities like `formatCurrency` and styling utilities 
- Budget calculation logic moved to shared package for consistent calculations
- Wedding tools list for navigation and discovery

### @wilma/shared-ui
- Reusable UI components like `Button`, `Card`, `Input`
- Common layout components like `Navigation`
- Wedding-themed card components

## Budget Calculator App Structure

### Components
- `BudgetCalculator.tsx`: Main component orchestrating the calculator flow
- `BudgetForm.tsx`: Form for collecting wedding details
- `LoadingAnimation.tsx`: Loading state with animation
- `BudgetResults.tsx`: Results display with actions
- `BudgetChart.tsx`: Visual pie chart of budget breakdown
- `CategoryBreakdown.tsx`: Detailed list of budget categories

### Integration with Shared Packages
- App uses shared UI components for consistent styling
- Leverages shared types for type safety across boundaries
- Uses shared utilities for calculations and formatting

### Styling
- Wedding-themed CSS variables available via shared package
- Consistent color scheme across all Wilma applications

## Package Dependencies
The following dependencies have been configured in package.json:
- Local dependencies on shared packages via workspace protocol
- React, React DOM as core dependencies
- Form handling with react-hook-form and zod
- Charting with recharts
- Animations with framer-motion

## Deployment Configuration
- Standalone deployment via Vercel configuration
- Development scripts available via Turbo

## Cross-Application Navigation
- Navigation component shows current active application
- Links between different Wilma tools
- "Back to Wilma" button for returning to main site

## Future Improvements
- Add deeper integration with other wedding planning tools
- Implement user accounts for saving budget plans
- Create export functionality to other formats

This migration ensures that the Budget Calculator can be developed and deployed independently while maintaining consistency with the Wilma ecosystem through shared code.
